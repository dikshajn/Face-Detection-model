    <p>📸 <b>Collecting and annotating images</b>:Gather a diverse dataset of images containing faces and annotate them with bounding boxes around the faces.</p>
    <p>🖼️ <b>Applying bounding augmentation</b>:Apply data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling to increase the variety of training data and improve model generalization.</p>
    <p>🔍 <b>Building a deep object detection model</b>: Construct a deep learning model for face detection, using architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector).</p>
    <p>📊 <b>Evaluating model performance</b>:Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).</p>
    <p>💻 <b>Detect faces in real-time</b>: Utilize the trained model to detect faces in real-time video streams, enabling various applications like surveillance and facial recognition systems.</p>
