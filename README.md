# Face-Detection-model

</head>
<body>
   

    <p>📸 <b>Collecting and Annotating Images:</b> Gather a diverse dataset of images containing faces and annotate them with bounding boxes around the faces.</p>

    <p>🖼️ <b>Applying Bounding Augmentation:</b> Apply data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling to increase the variety of training data and improve model generalization.</p>

    <p>🚀 <b>Build a Deep Object Detection Model:</b> Construct a deep learning model for face detection, using architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector).</p>

    <p>📊 <b>Evaluating Model Performance:</b> Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).</p>

    <p>👀 <b>Detect Faces in Real Time:</b> Utilize the trained model to detect faces in real-time video streams, enabling various applications like surveillance and facial recognition systems.</p>

    <p>For detailed instructions and code implementation, please refer to the project's documentation.</p>
