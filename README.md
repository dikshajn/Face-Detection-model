    <h1>Face Detection Model</h1>

    <h2>1. Collecting and Annotating Images</h2>
    <p>Describe the process of gathering images of faces and annotating them with bounding boxes.</p>

    <h2>2. Applying Bounding Augmentation</h2>
    <p>Explain how bounding augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the dataset.</p>

    <h2>3. Building a Deep Object Detection Model</h2>
    <p>Detail the architecture and training process of the deep learning model for face detection.</p>

    <h2>4. Evaluating Model Performance</h2>
    <p>Discuss methods for evaluating the performance of the face detection model, such as precision, recall, and F1 score.</p>

    <h2>5. Detecting Faces in Real Time</h2>
    <p>Explain how the trained model is deployed to detect faces in real-time video streams.</p>
